I am a PhD student at Harvard in many-body quantum physics. I am fortunate to be working with [Professor Norman Yao](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/norman-y-yao). I am a member of the inaugural cohort of the Quantum Science and Engineering program, part of the [Harvard Quantum Initiative](https://quantum.harvard.edu/). I am broadly interested in theoretical out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, topological phases and aspects of AI in many-body physics.

Not doing physics I mostly spend my time exercising, running/cycling and playing banjo.

In the past, I have spent my time in the capital of England at UCL and at the [London Centre for Nanotechnology](https://www.london-nano.com/). I graduated with master's degrees in Physics and Quantum Technologies. I hail from [Lublin, Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lublin).
