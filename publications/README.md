<summary>Skier and loop the loop with friction </summary>
<div markdown="1">
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">**Field:** Classical Mechanics <br> **Main points:** Developed analytical solutions to the extension of two ‘classic’ problems in classical mechanics.  </span>
</div>

<summary>Alternative quantisation condition for wavepacket dynamics in a hyperbolic double well</summary>
<div markdown="1">
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">**Field:** Atomic Physics <br> **Main points:** Proposed a new analytical way of finding allowed energies in the class of hyperbolic-double well potentials by connecting it to a problem of finding roots of some polynomial. Applied this approach to understanding the role of non-adiabatic effects during enhanced ionization. </span>

<summary>Online Learning and matching for resource allocation problems </summary>
<div markdown="1">
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">**Field:** Machine Learning <br> **Main points:** Devised, provided performance guarantees, and implemented algorithms integrating dual problems in convex optimization with a subclass of reinforcement learning techniques. Applied these algorithms to the traffic-shaping problem. </span>

<summary>Analytical modelling of temperature effects on AMPA-type synapse </summary>
<div markdown="1">
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">**Field:** Computational Neuroscience <br> **Main Points:** Used ODE-based modelling for understanding temperature effects on AMPA-type synapses in brain. Simplified the ODEs using some physically-motivated assumptions and shown how the obtained analytical solution faithfully reproduces the results of biological experiments. </span>
