title: How to cook delicious spherical chicken ft. thermodynamics?
description: This is a gif made out of the early-year-undergrad targeted talk slides featuring heat equation and dimensional analysis in context of cooking spherical chicken. Talk was given during UCL departmental retreat to beautiful Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Park (Nov. 2019) and later repeated during Physics&Astronomy (PandA) day at UCL in Feb. 2020.

Fun fact: These talks in some communities earned me a "chicken guy" <a href="#1">nickname</a>.
